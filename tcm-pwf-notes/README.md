## Quick note for TCM-PWF

Hi! recently, I took a course: "Practical Windows Forensics" on TCM Security. This course taught by **Markus Schober** (aka **[@mascho](https://twitter.com/mascho)**) and here is my short review of the course:

- Course content: This course teaches students a lot of forensics topics focus on windows: eventlogs, process execution, ntfs, registry and memory forensics. At the end of course, you learn how to create a timeline for the analysis process.

- Course structure: Very good! start with simulation of redteam ops, then collection, examination, analysis and reporting

- The instructor: Markus is a great instructor, he has many years of experience in DFIR and he is also very enthusiastic on Discord channel to supporting the students

In short, I appreciate this course and highly recommended it to you. This repo contains only my short notes during the course.
